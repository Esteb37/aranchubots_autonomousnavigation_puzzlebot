#Local planner uses local costmap to calculate local plans
#Created directly from sensor readings 
#Depending on where on the map the robot is currently at that's the obstacle
#information that will be showed in RVIZ. This is due to the rolling window approach
#This optimizes computer resources 
#Local costmap detects new objects that appear in the simulation, global costmap don't
local_costmap:
   #Global frame for local costmap. Must be odom if no static map is used
   #map used in Jackal course
   global_frame: map #Default: odom
   robot_base_frame: base_link #Default: base_link
   #How often (frequency) the local costmap will be updated 
   #Cycle: sensor data comes in, marking and clearing operations, 
   #cost values assigned to each cell in grid of costmap, obstacle inflation 
   #is performed where needed (in cells with obstacles values)
   update_frequency: 20.0 #Default: 5.0
   publish_frequency: 5.0
   #Width of costmap
   width: 10.0 #Default: 10
